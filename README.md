# AI Query Assistant

I'm currently building a bigger project that would require me to use AI. This small task however, is a simple AI-powered query assistant built with Nuxt 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Users can input a prompt or question, and OpenAI will return a generated response. 
It's a minimal yet functional demonstration of integrating OpenAI's API into a Nuxt application.
Warming me up for the bigger picture ðŸ˜‰


I don't expect anyone to have to clone, but if so:

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
